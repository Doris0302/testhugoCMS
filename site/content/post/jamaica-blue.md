**蔡英文總統日前提名國民黨籍的前台東縣縣長黃健庭任監察院副院長，結果藍綠兩黨都不支持，引發爭議。黃健庭昨（26日）接受廣播專訪還原事件始末，發展完全在意料之外，昨晚他也在個人臉書貼文，還自嘲「明年5月我得特別小心」。**



總統府原訂19日公布監察委員提名人選，基於朝野大和解的考量，副院長預定邀請國民黨籍前台東縣長黃健庭出任，未料消息曝光後，藍綠兩黨都不支持，黃健庭主動在20日婉謝提名。

黃健庭表示，其實他和妻子很喜歡卸任後自由自在的生活，有更多時間閱讀、運動、靈修、陪家人，四處演講分享台東經驗。話鋒一轉，黃健庭說，「奇妙的是，連續兩年5月都有意想不到的事發生。」黃健庭指出，去年是郭台銘董事長搭檔參選的邀請，今年則是蔡英文總統監察院副院長的提名；讓黃健庭每次都問自己「這件事有意義嗎？」

黃健庭表示，即便後來事情的發展出乎意料，回到原來平靜的生活，多了些磨練和體悟，然而他相信上帝在這當中有祂的美意。最後不忘強調說，「政治實在太複雜，明年5月我得特別小心。」

## A little history

The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.

> Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.

This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak.
